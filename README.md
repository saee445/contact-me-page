# contact-me-page
Sample Contact Page for My Portfolio Website

I recently created a sample Contact Me page as part of my web development practice. This simple form allows users to enter their name, email, and message, and also includes direct contact links and social media profiles like LinkedIn, GitHub, and GeeksforGeeks.

#Key features:

Clean HTML structure

Basic form fields for user input

Direct email and phone links

Organized social media section

This is part of my ongoing journey to strengthen front-end skills. Feedback and suggestions are welcome!
